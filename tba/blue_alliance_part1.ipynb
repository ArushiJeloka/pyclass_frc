    "# Analyzing Blue Alliance Data with Python\n",
    "[The Blue Alliance](http://www.thebluealliance.com) is an extensive online repository of FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) data. The Blue Alliance (TBA) contains detailed information on every single FRC match. [Click here for an example.](https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2020wasno_qf2m1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition providing information website, TBA makes all FRC competition data available via hyptetext transfer protocol (HTTP). The FRC data is provided as javascript object notation (JSON) text, which can be read by Python. This allows us find new ways to analyze and visualize FRC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through retrieving FRC JSON data via HTTP, reading that data into Python, and generating a graph to visualize the data."
